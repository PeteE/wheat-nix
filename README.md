# Overview
This repo contains the config for all my Nix boxes.


# TODO
- spend more time on nushell
- add functions for QOL az-cli usage
- add `nn` and nix-output-mon`
- btop catppuccin
- alt-tab between windows on all virtual screens
- shell history should not wipe out lines above it but maintain state (more like a popup window)
- tmux refactor

## Additional Systems / TODO
- pi-zero
- hv - decommission from existing k3s cluster and migrate
- ripper - ugh not sure, too many VMS
- ripper-nos - nixos VM -- probably don't need anymore
